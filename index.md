#### Morning walk!
<p>I love going
for 
morning walks.<br>
   Sometimes,
I run too.<br>
  I miss
going to the 
park.<br>
   
  I am thinking of 
running in a 
marathon.</p>



## Mississippi Mud
I terribly miss ***mississippi mud*** ice cream.
<p>I feel miserable without mississippi mud. <br>
  Why is mississippi mud so missable? </p>

# Time

                The way people talk
about time is
weird. They keep saying that they
don't have time and then they would
ask
me how do 
I pass my time if I am
not very active on 
social media.
Well I am highly active in my 
real life,
and if I get bored I just
look around,
listen to birds chirp,
feel the blowing wind,
observe people,
look at the sky,
look at the 
tall palm tress
and wonder.
